I've yet to find an optimal solution for managing configurations for every operational system I use (ArchLinux, MacOS, Windows). Since there are just a few tools I need to start working on, this will be my only public configuration repository.

All I need to start is a minimal shell, a gitconfig, a package manager of choice, and SSH backed by GnuPG from Yubikey. So, after running ~./setup~, it'll place all the configurations correctly for those!
