# Kickstart my +heart+ environment

> Ansible playbook used to set up my machine from scratch

You can clone this repository, check the default configuration at `group_vars/all.yml` and select only the ones you want in `host_vars/localhost.yml`. After you configure the variables to your preferences, all that's left is to run `./setup -k kind -m module`, which will install everything that I use on a daily basis.
