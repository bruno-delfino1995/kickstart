# Kickstart my ~~heart~~ environment

> Configure your fresh machine with Python 🔥🐍

You can clone this repository, check the example configuration at `host_data/example.py`, select only the ones you want in `host_data/local.py`. After you configure the variables to your preferences, all that's left is to run `pyinfra inventory.py deploy.py`, which will install everything that I use on a daily basis.

It's actually more than that 😅 You'll need to install Python through mise, install dependencies, and only then run the above command. In doubt, you're better off checking one the post installation steps from one of the [guides](./guides).
